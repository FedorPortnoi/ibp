## Feature Completion vs Original Spec

### 8-Stage Pipeline: **100% wired, ~90% data quality**

| Stage | Wired | Real Data | Demo Fallback | Notes |
|-------|-------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| 1. Gov Registries | Yes | EGRUL + sudact.ru work | Empty results | FSSP has Playwright retry (2 attempts), bankruptcy needs Russian IP |
| 2. Security Checks | Yes | Interpol works globally | Empty results | Russian sanctions need Russian IP |
| 3. Social Media | Yes | VK + Telegram + OK work | 3 fake VK + 3 fake OK profiles | Yandex may timeout (CAPTCHA) |
| 4. Contact Discovery | Yes | 11-step chain fully wired | Empty results | Paid APIs return empty without keys (no fake data) |
| 5. Social Analysis | Yes | Search4Faces + graph work | Demo graph data | Snoop needs local tool |
| 6. Behavioral Analysis | Yes | Text/geo/timeline work | Demo data | Requires VK wall access |
| 7. Risk Scoring | Yes | 8 categories scored | Scores empty data | Always produces a level |
| 8. Report Generation | Yes | Full dossier + PDF | Works with any data | Identity card, vis.js graph, geo map |

### Contact Discovery 11-Step Chain (Stage 4)

| Step | What | Source Key | Confidence |
|------|------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | VK profile contacts | `vk_profile_contacts` | 0.95 |
| 2 | Telegram profile data | `telegram` | 0.85 |
| 3 | Business/FSSP records | `egrul` / `fssp` | 0.50 / 0.45 |
| 4 | Email guessing (username + transliteration) | `email_guess` | 0.40 |
| 5 | LeakDB name lookup | `leak_db` | 0.65 |
| 6 | Breach API enrichment (HudsonRock, LeakCheck, ProxyNova) | `breach_api` | 0.60 |
| 7 | LeakDB cross-reference (phone→email, email→phone) | `leak_db_xref` | 0.55 |
| 8 | Forgot-password oracle (8 services) | `forgot_password_*` | 0.78-0.90 |
| 9 | Marketplace mining (6 platforms) | `marketplace` | 0.90 |
| 10 | Holehe email verification | `holehe_verified` | 0.80 |
| 11 | Deduplicate + merge sources + cross-source boost | — | +0.15 boost |

### Confidence Scoring System

- Numeric scores 0.0-1.0 per source type (`CONFIDENCE_SCORES` dict in `contact_discovery.py`)
- Russian labels preserved: `высокая` (>=0.75), `средняя` (>=0.50), `низкая` (<0.50)
- Cross-source boost: +0.15 when 3+ independent sources confirm same phone/email
- Max cap: 0.98
- Each contact tracks full `sources` list for auditability

## What Works End-to-End in Demo Mode

These features work without any API keys configured:

1. Start a candidate check (quick or precise mode)
2. All 8 stages execute (with demo/empty data)
3. Progress bar tracks all 8 stages in real-time
4. Precise mode pauses at Stage 3 for profile confirmation
5. Risk scoring produces a risk level (CLEAN with no data)
6. Dossier page renders with all tabs (social graph, geo, behavioral, accounts)
7. PDF export generates a downloadable file
8. JSON export includes all stage data
9. OK.ru demo profiles appear in Phase 1 search results

**20 E2E demo tests pass** (`tests/test_demo_e2e.py`)

## What Needs Real API Keys

| API Key | What It Enables | Cost |
|---------|----------------|------|
| `VK_SERVICE_TOKEN` | Real VK profiles, social graph, wall posts | Free (create VK app) |
| `TELEGRAM_API_ID/HASH/PHONE` | Telegram profile search | Free (my.telegram.org) |
| `OK_SESSION_TOKEN` | Real OK.ru profile search (demo fallback if unset) | Free (login to OK.ru) |
| `SNUSBASE_API_KEY` | Extended breach database | $5-16/mo |
| `DEHASHED_EMAIL/API_KEY` | Extended breach database | $5.49/mo |
| `LEAKCHECK_API_KEY` | Pro breach database (free public tier if unset) | $2.99-24.99/mo |
| `HIBP_API_KEY` | Email breach lookup (free k-anonymity if unset) | $3.50/mo |
| `GETCONTACT_API_KEY` | Phone-to-name reverse lookup | Paid |
| `NUMBUSTER_API_KEY` | Phone lookup | Paid |
| `HUNTER_API_KEY` | Email verification (25/mo free) | Free tier available |
| `FSSP_API_TOKEN` | Enforcement proceedings API | Free but needs Russian IP |

**Important**: Without paid keys, services return **empty lists** (not fake data). Mock data was removed entirely.

## What Needs Russian IP

| Source | Impact Without Russian IP |
|--------|--------------------------|
| FSSP API | SSL errors, Playwright retry with 3s delay, falls back to manual URL |
| EFRSB bankruptcy | May fail, Playwright fallback |
| Rosfinmonitoring sanctions | Cannot scrape, returns unchecked |
| MVD wanted list | Cannot scrape, returns unchecked |
| Extremist list | Cannot scrape, returns unchecked |
| kad.arbitr.ru (arbitration) | HTTP 451 blocked entirely |
| Forgot-password oracle (Gosuslugi, Sberbank) | Geo-blocked, returns empty |

**Works globally**: nalog.ru EGRUL, sudact.ru courts, Interpol, VK API, Telegram API, all breach APIs, Search4Faces, OK.ru demo, Holehe, marketplace scanners

## New Services Added (2026-02-26)

### Forgot-Password Oracle (`app/services/phase2/forgot_password_oracle.py`)
- **8 Russian service checkers**: VK, Mail.ru, Yandex, OK, Gosuslugi, Telegram, Avito, Sberbank
- Submits phone/email to password recovery endpoints
- Extracts masked hints (e.g., "i***@mail.ru", "+7***567")
- Cross-correlates hints across services for multi-source confirmation
- Wired into contact discovery Step 8

### Marketplace Scanner (`app/services/phase2/marketplace_scanner.py`)
- **6 platform scanners**: Avito, Youla, CIAN, Auto.ru, Yandex Search, VK Market
- Searches by name and confirmed phone numbers
- Extracts phone numbers from classified listings
- Wired into contact discovery Step 9

### OK.ru Search Integration (`app/services/phase1/ok_search_integration.py`)
- Odnoklassniki people search with web scraping
- Demo mode generates 3 reproducible fake profiles when `OK_SESSION_TOKEN` is not set
- Name similarity scoring with `difflib.SequenceMatcher`
- Wired into Phase 1 route alongside VK search

### Enhanced VK Wall Extractor
- Tagged posts scanning (`wall.get filter=others`) — posts by others on subject's wall
- Photo comments scanning (`photos.getComments`)
- Expanded profile fields: Instagram, Skype, career/employer, Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal

## Test Results (2026-02-26)

| Category | Tests | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Unit tests (tests/unit/) | ~2,400 | All pass |
| Integration tests (root-level test_*.py) | ~580 | All pass |
| Demo E2E tests (test_demo_e2e.py) | 20 | All pass |
| Candidate pipeline tests (test_candidate_unified.py) | 53 | All pass |
| **Total** | **~3,756** | **0 failures, 0 errors** |

Excluded from count:
- `tests/test_phase1.py`, `tests/test_phase3_e2e.py` — Playwright E2E requiring running server
- `tests/test_suite1-8_*.py` — Standalone scripts (not pytest)
- `tests/test_full_workflow.py` — Full network integration (requires live APIs)

## Priority List: What to Build Next

### P0 — Deploy to Production
1. **Get a Russian VPS/proxy** — Many data sources are geo-blocked
2. **Paste paid API keys** — Snusbase, DeHashed, GetContact, etc.
3. **Deploy to Render** — Verify production config, health checks

### P1 — High Value
4. **Wire Snoop/Maigret into Stage 5** — External tools exist locally, need subprocess integration
5. **Rate limiting** — Add Flask-Limiter to public endpoints
6. **Russian IP proxy config** — SOCKS5 proxy for geo-blocked sources

### P2 — Medium Value
7. **Instagram/Twitter/TikTok** — Requires new scraping services
8. **SourceManager plugin auto-discovery in Stage 4** — Replace manual chain with plugin system
9. **Improve E2E test coverage** — Full Playwright test of candidate check flow with real data

### P3 — Nice to Have
10. **Property/Vehicle registries** — Requires Russian government API access
11. **Multi-user auth** — Flask-Login with user roles
12. **Real-time monitoring** — Periodic re-checks with change detection

## Known Technical Debt

| Issue | Impact | Fix Effort |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| `per_profile_search.py` (2,695 lines) | Dead code, superseded by combined_search | Delete after confirming no imports |
| OSINT knowledge routes (5,354 lines) | Massive static data in route files | Move to JSON/YAML data files |
| No CSRF on all forms | Security gap | Add Flask-WTF csrf_token to all forms |
| No rate limiting | DoS vulnerability | Add Flask-Limiter |
| Error handler returns exception details | Information disclosure | Strip details in production |
| WeasyPrint reference in dossier.py | Always fails on Windows | Remove, use Playwright only |
| Duplicate SECRET_KEY / FLASK_SECRET_KEY | Confusing | Consolidate to one var |
| pytest I/O error running full suite at once | Windows stderr issue | Run test files individually |
